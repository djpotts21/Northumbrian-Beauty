# The Beauty of Northumberland

Our web application aims to provide an immersive experience for tourists and visitors to Northumberland by combining various features. Utilizing Google Map markers, the application showcases the breathtaking beauty spots scattered throughout the Northumberland region. Users can explore these spots by accessing detailed information, reviews, and ratings. Additionally, the integration with Booking.com allows users to conveniently find and book hotels and accommodations in the surrounding area. The web application also offers a 16-day weather forecast, providing up-to-date information on temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions. To enhance the experience further, the inclusion of webcams enables users to enjoy live views of the area, allowing them to witness the beauty of Northumberland in real-time. With this comprehensive approach, our web application aims to assist users in planning their trip, discovering hidden gems, and making the most of their visit to Northumberland.

## Scope of work
### Project Goals
    1. A responsive website available on all devices.
    2. The website should be easy to read for all users.
    3. The website should be one page that uses Javascript to update the page with information relevent to the buttons clicked.
    4. The website should compliment the colors of the Northumberland Flag (Pantone and HEX colours are detailed below).

### Deliverables
